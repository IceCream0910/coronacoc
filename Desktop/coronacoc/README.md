## Reporting Issues

We use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for the Argon Dashboard. Here are some advices for our users that want to report an issue:

2. Providing us reproducible steps for the issue will shorten the time it takes for it to be fixed.
3. Some issues may be browser specific, so specifying in what browser you encountered the issue might help.
